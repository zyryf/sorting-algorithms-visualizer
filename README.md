# Sorting algorithms visualization

Application shows in the neat way how the most popular sorting algorithms perform on the same randomly generated data.

The delay was added to illustrate specific time-complexity of each algorithm of the following algortihms:

* selection sort
* insertion sort
* bubble sort

Green bars indicate the sorted part of the data and the red bar points to the currently examinated bar.
